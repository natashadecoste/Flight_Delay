# Flight Delay #

	This project is intended to advise the user of overall average flight delays from an origin to a destination. It is implemented in Java. The user interface is implemented using JavaFX and the Scenebuilder. 

	It was decomposed into the MVC modules (Model, View, Controller). Each Module is comprised of submodules.


**********************************************************************************************

## Module Decomposition ##

	Controller Module
		Relays between the logic in the model and the graphical User interface created by the View.
	Model Module
		Contains the logic for the game. Implements sub-modules that contain Searching and Sorting modules. 
	View Module
		Creates the Stage for JavaFX GUI. Integrates the fxml files with overlayed dynamically created objects specified through the Model.
